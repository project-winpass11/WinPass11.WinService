# Contributing
Due to the person writing this only using C# for 2 days (no joke), the code probably sucks, so make it good.

## Prequisites
* Make sure you have a GitHub account.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes
>Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work, typically the master branch.

>Only target release branches if you are certain your changes are consurned with that branch.

>To quickly create a topic branch based on master, `run git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master`.

>Avoid working directly on the master branch.

>Make commits of logical and atomic units.

>Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

# Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the puppetlabs organization.
